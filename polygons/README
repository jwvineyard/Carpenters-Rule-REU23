In order to test the unfolding algorithm, we need some interesting polygons and
arcs to try and unfold.

The files forest-200.txt, phoenix-100.txt, starship-50.txt, and hedgehog-25.txt
contain polygons with the indicated number of vertices encoded as a list of
ordered pairs. The noun at the start of each file is what I think they look
like in order to distinguish them. For example, phoenix-100.txt contains a
polygon with 100 vertices that I think looks like a phoenix.

The polygons were first generated using the Random Polygon Generator (RPG),
which can be found here:

https://github.com/cgalab/genpoly-rpg

Then, the clean.sh script cleans up the output from RPG into a common format.

The display.py script can be used to view a polygon.

The convert.sh script turns a polygon file into a format suitable to copy and
paste into the Julia unfolding program.

Note that both clean.sh and convert.sh were tested only on linux, and might not
work on MacOS (and likely will not work on Windows).
