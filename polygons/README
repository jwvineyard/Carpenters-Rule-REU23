In order to test the unfolding algorithm, we need some interesting polygons and
arcs to try and unfold.

The files forest-200.txt, phoenix-100.txt, starship-50.txt, and hedgehog-25.txt
contain polygons with the indicated number of vertices encoded as a list of
ordered pairs. The noun at the start of each file is what I think they look
like in order to distinguish them. For example, phoenix-100.txt contains a
polygon with 100 vertices that I think looks like a phoenix.

The polygons were first generated using the Random Polygon Generator (RPG),
which can be found here:

https://github.com/cgalab/genpoly-rpg

Then, the clean.py script cleans up the output from RPG into a common format.

The display.py script can be used to view a polygon.

The convert.py script turns a polygon file into a format suitable to copy and
paste into the Julia unfolding program.

The alphashape directory contains another method for generating random shapes
that has not been as developed yet.
